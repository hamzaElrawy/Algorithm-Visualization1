# Sort Visualizer

## Overview
**Sort Visualizer** is a Python-based project designed to help you understand sorting algorithms through vibrant, animated visualizations. Using the `Tkinter` library, this program demonstrates three popular sorting algorithms in action:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

With this visualizer, you can observe the step-by-step process of sorting an array of numbers, making it a fun and educational tool for teens and beginners.
